## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This directory contains important **Stack** and **Queue** interview questions.

---

## ðŸ“š Stack
A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.

### ðŸ”¹ **Stack Operations:**
- **Push(x):** Insert element `x` on top.
- **Pop():** Remove and return the top element.
- **Peek()/Top():** Return the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty():** Check if the stack is empty.

### ðŸ”¹ **Conceptual Interview Questions:**
âœ… What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an array vs. a linked list to implement a stack?  
âœ… Can a stack be implemented using only one queue? If yes, how?  
âœ… How does recursion use the stack internally? Explain with an example.  
âœ… What are some real-world applications of a stack?  
âœ… What is tail recursion, and how does the compiler optimize it using a stack?  
âœ… How can you implement two stacks in a single array efficiently?  
âœ… How does the stack memory differ from the heap memory in program execution?  
âœ… What is stack overflow? How can it be prevented in recursion?  
âœ… How does a call stack work in function execution?  
âœ… What are some problems where a stack is not the ideal data structure?  

### ðŸ”¹ **Problem-Solving Questions:**
âœ… Reverse a string using a stack.  
âœ… Check for balanced parentheses in an expression.  
âœ… Evaluate a postfix expression.  
âœ… Convert infix to postfix expression.

âœ… Implement a queue using a stack.  
âœ… Check if a given sequence of stack operations is valid.  
âœ… Implement a min-max stack.  
âœ… Implement a monotonic stack.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Topics and Edge Cases:**
âœ… Why is a stack preferred over recursion in some scenarios (e.g., iterative DFS vs. recursive DFS)?  
âœ… How does JVM or Python handle stack memory allocation for function calls?  
âœ… How does stack unwinding work during exception handling?  
âœ… How does a segmented stack help in preventing stack overflow?  
âœ… How can a stack be used for backtracking in problems like Sudoku solving or N-Queens?  
âœ… How to implement a concurrent stack in a multi-threaded environment?  
âœ… How can a stack be used in a browserâ€™s forward-backward navigation system?  
âœ… How does tail call optimization (TCO) remove stack usage in functional programming?  

### ðŸ”¹ **Commonly Asked FAANG Stack Problems:**

## ðŸ“š Queue
A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle.

### ðŸ”¹ **Queue Operations:**
- **Enqueue(x):** Insert element `x` at the rear.
- **Dequeue():** Remove and return the front element.
- **Peek()/Front():** Return the front element without removing it.
- **isEmpty():** Check if the queue is empty.
