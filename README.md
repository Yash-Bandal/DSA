# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
 
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains implementations of essential **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in C++.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics To Be Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Linear Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular) 
- Stacks
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Deque, Priority Queue)

### ðŸ”¹ Non-Linear Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Trie, Segment Tree, etc.)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
Later
DPs and More

 
### ðŸ”¹ Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Counting, Radix, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, Interpolation Search)
- Sliding window
- Recursion & Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Subset Sum, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LCS, LIS, Matrix Chain Multiplication, etc.)
- Greedy Algorithms (Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal, Prim, etc.)
- Bit Manipulation Techniques
