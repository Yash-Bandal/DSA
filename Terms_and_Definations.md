# Terms and Definitions
 
## 1. Parity
 Parity refers to the evenness or oddness of a number, often used in computing and data transmission to detect errors. Parity can be classified into two types:
- **Even Parity**: The number of 1s in the data is even.
- **Odd Parity**: The number of 1s in the data is odd.

## 2. Combinatorics
 Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics focused on counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. It plays a vital role in various fields like computer science, particularly in algorithm design, cryptography, and network theory. Key concepts in combinatorics include permutations, combinations, and graph theory.
 
## 3. Lexicographical Order
 Lexicographical order is the generalization of the way words are alphabetically ordered in dictionaries. It is a sequence of strings sorted based on their characters, with the first character being the most significant. If two strings share a common prefix, the string with the shorter length is considered smaller. This order is used in many computational algorithms, particularly in string sorting and searching.
